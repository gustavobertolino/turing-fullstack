# turing-fullstack
Build an awesome t-shirt shop

**Overview**

In this challenge you will build an e-commerce system which allows users to search, add items to their shopping cart, 
create order and checkout successfully. Given a database in MySQL, you will need to implement the backend and frontend 
(Check out the files at: https://github.com/zandoan/turing-fullstack). There are a lot of stored procedures inside the database.

If you are strong in Node and React, please do this challenge in Node and React, since we have maximum customers who want 
Node+React full stack engineers, and lot of opportunities to match you quickly for medium to long term projects, if you do 
exceptional work in this project. If are not familiar with one or both of these frameworks, please feel free to use other 
frameworks/languages (Angular, Vue, PHP, C#, Python, Clojure, etc.). We have fewer customers interested in full stack engineers 
skilled in these other technologies, but they still exist and we can match you if you do exceptional work in this project.

Any advanced techniques, tools, frameworks used in the code will also give you bonus points. Please add notes in the readme 
file so we can easily find and evaluate them. Our customer companies have very high standards for software engineers, 
so please do your best possible work here, to impress them.

Core expectations

1. UI Design: clean and responsive design. You can use 3rd party component libraries. Use modern structure/technology you know (SCSS, HTML5, flex) in HTML/CSS.

2. Functionalities: work well as expected. Precise inputs/outputs. Users can go through flows smoothly. No critical bugs.

3. System Design: Use most advanced system architecture as you can.

4. Coding: clean code. Good coding style. Good comments. Easy to read, debug, and add more stuffs.

5. Testing: You should add test cases for main functions of the system.

6. Deployment: Host your solution online and give us the link of the website.

7. Documentation: work well as expected. Precise inputs/outputs. Users can go through flows smoothly. No critical bugs.

8. Source Code: Please upload your source code on Github, set it private, invite TuringCom as Collaborator, and send the link to us.
